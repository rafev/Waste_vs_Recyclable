# Waste vs Recyclable
The notebook within this repo contain demonstrates transfer learning and pre-trained model fine-tuned of the VGG16 Convolution Neural Network model from the Keras library. This fine-tuned model was developed to classify images as either organic waste or recyclable.

Within the notebook is a full walkthrough showing how data was loaded, the model building process, training, and performance validation. Additionally, there are visualizations included to assess the dataset, overall model performance, and prediction accuracies.
